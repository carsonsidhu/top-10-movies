## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
This site was my way of keeping a log of my favourite movies of all time. I'm a huge fan of watching movies and love having a good recommendation
on hand for any of my friends, appropriate for any occasion. However, I've never had the chance to collect my thoughts, and create a top 10 list
of my favourite movies, with accompanying reviews and scores. This website aims to provide a framework for anyone wishing to do the same.


## Technologies Used
- Flask
- Python
- SQLite
- SQLAlchemy


## Features
List the ready features here:
- SQLAlchemy allows users to easily generate an SQLite database, where movie titles, ratings, and reviews can be uploaded
- Flask framework generates a clean, easy to navigate website for users to navigate


## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_ 


## Room for Improvement
Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development.

Room for improvement:
- Some imported libraries are not readily available on community edition software IDE's, may need to find a workaround to improve accessibility
for all users
- Website to be published to a domain for public visibility
